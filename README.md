</p>

This repository is a prototype for a [Live Activity](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/live-activities) that displays real-time information for professional Counter-Strike matches.

The current design is heavily inspired by [Apple Sports](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-sports-app/welcome/1.0/web/1.0), with a different layout designed to display relevant Counter-Strike match data.

The groundwork has been laid for the Live Activity to recieve real data from a server application through [Broadcast Push Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting-up-broadcast-push-notifications/).
